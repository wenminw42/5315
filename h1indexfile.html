      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker provides container software using shared operating systems for developers and teams to experimenting applications. A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. </p>
