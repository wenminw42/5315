      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker provides container software using shared operating systems for developers and teams to experimenting applications. A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. </p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming and so on. Nginx as a web server, its goal is to create the fastest web server and maintain the excellence. It supports all the components of the modern Web, including WebSocket, HTTP/2 and streaming of multiple video formats (HDS, HLS, RTMP and others) now. <br>
      The Nginx project started with a strong focus on high concurrency, high performance and low memory usage. It is licensed under the 2-clause BSD-like license and it runs on Linux, BSD variants, Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, as well as on other *nix flavors. It also has a proof of concept port for Microsoft Windows. <br>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window giving the end user the same experience on a virtual mahchine as they would have on the host operating system itself. The software inside a virtual machine cannot escape or tamper with the computer itself. It is an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they were not originally intended for.<br> 
      Multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously on the same physical computer. For servers, the multiple operating systems run side-by-side with a piece of software called a hupervisor to manage them, while desktop computers typical employ one operating system to run the other operating systems within its program windows. Each virtual machine provides its own virtual hardware, including CPUs, memory, hard drives, network interfaces, and other devices. The virtual hardware is then mapped to the real hardware on the physical machine which saves costs by reducing the need for physical hardware systems along with the associated maintenance costs that go with it, plus reduces power and cooling demand.<br>Reference: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is an American cloud infrasture provider that provisions virtual servers for software developers. The company is headquartered in New York City and possesses data centers worldwide. Digital Ocean provides cloud services that help developers deploy and scale applications that run on multiple computers simultaneously. Digital Ocean is also a reliable cloud hosting comparing with shared hosting. Becuase cloud hosting isolates each servver, ensuring that possible stress on one does not affect another server's performance. Whereas the shared hosting may having issues of affecting the actual server and other users when one user makes a mistake.<br>
